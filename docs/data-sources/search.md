  Search Data Source
  The search data source allows you to search for entities in Port.
  See the Port documentation https://docs.getport.io/search-and-query/ for more information about the search capabilities in Port.
  Example Usage
  Search for all entities in a specific blueprint:
  
  
  data "port_search" "all_service" {
    query = jsonencode({
      "combinator" : "and", "rules" : [
        { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$blueprint", "value" : "Service" },
      ]
    })
  }
  
  
  
  Search for entity with specific identifier in a specific blueprint to create another resource based on the values of the entity:
  
  
  data "port_search" "ads_service" {
    query = jsonencode({
      "combinator" : "and", "rules" : [
        { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$blueprint", "value" : "Service" },
        { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$identifier", "value" : "Ads" },
      ]
    })
  }
  
  
  
  Scorecards automation example
  In this example we are creating a jira task for each service that its Ownership Scorecard hasn't reached Gold level :
  
  
  data "port_search" "all_services" {
    query = jsonencode({
      "combinator" : "and", "rules" : [
        { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$blueprint", "value" : "microservice" },
      ]
    })
  }
  
  locals {
    // Count the number of services that are not owned by a team with a Gold level
    microservice_ownership_without_gold_level = length([
      for entity in data.port_search.all_services.entities : entity.scorecards["ownership"].level
      if entity.scorecards["ownership"].level != "Gold"
    ])
  }
  
  // create jira issue per service that is not owned by a team with a Gold level
  resource "jira_issue" "microservice_ownership_without_gold_level" {
    count      = local.microservice_ownership_without_gold_level
    issue_type = "Task"
  
    project_key = "PORT"
  
    summary     = "Service ${data.port_search.backend_services.entities[count.index].title} hasn't reached Gold level in Ownership Scorecard"
    description = "[Service](https://app.getport.io/${port_blueprint.microservice.identifier}Entity/${data.port_search.backend_services.entities[count.index].identifier}) is not owned by a team with a Gold level, please assign a team with a Gold level to the service"
  }

# port_search (Data Source)

# Search Data Source

The search data source allows you to search for entities in Port.

See the [Port documentation](https://docs.getport.io/search-and-query/) for more information about the search capabilities in Port.

## Example Usage

### Search for all entities in a specific blueprint:

```hcl

data "port_search" "all_service" {
  query = jsonencode({
    "combinator" : "and", "rules" : [
      { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$blueprint", "value" : "Service" },
    ]
  })
}


```

### Search for entity with specific identifier in a specific blueprint to create another resource based on the values of the entity:


```hcl

data "port_search" "ads_service" {
  query = jsonencode({
    "combinator" : "and", "rules" : [
      { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$blueprint", "value" : "Service" },
      { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$identifier", "value" : "Ads" },
    ]
  })
}


```

### Scorecards automation example
In this example we are creating a jira task for each service that its Ownership Scorecard hasn't reached Gold level : 

```hcl

data "port_search" "all_services" {
  query = jsonencode({
    "combinator" : "and", "rules" : [
      { "operator" : "=", "property" : "$blueprint", "value" : "microservice" },
    ]
  })
}

locals {
  // Count the number of services that are not owned by a team with a Gold level
  microservice_ownership_without_gold_level = length([
    for entity in data.port_search.all_services.entities : entity.scorecards["ownership"].level
    if entity.scorecards["ownership"].level != "Gold"
  ])
}

// create jira issue per service that is not owned by a team with a Gold level
resource "jira_issue" "microservice_ownership_without_gold_level" {
  count      = local.microservice_ownership_without_gold_level
  issue_type = "Task"

  project_key = "PORT"

  summary     = "Service ${data.port_search.backend_services.entities[count.index].title} hasn't reached Gold level in Ownership Scorecard"
  description = "[Service](https://app.getport.io/${port_blueprint.microservice.identifier}Entity/${data.port_search.backend_services.entities[count.index].identifier}) is not owned by a team with a Gold level, please assign a team with a Gold level to the service"
}


```
