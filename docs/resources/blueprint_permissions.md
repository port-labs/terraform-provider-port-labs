  Blueprint Permissions resource
  Docs about blueprint permissions can be found here https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/examples/#setting-blueprint-permissions
  
  resource "port_blueprint_permissions" "microservices_permissions" {
  	blueprint_identifier = "my_blueprint_identifier"
  		entities             = {
  			"register" = {
  				"roles" : [
  					"Member",
  				],
  				"users" : [],
  				"teams" : []
  			},
  		}
  	}
  }
  
  Example Usage
  Allow access to all members:
  
  resource "port_blueprint_permissions" "microservices_permissions" {
  	blueprint_identifier = "my_blueprint_identifier"
  		entities             = {
  			"register" = {
  				"roles" : [
  					"Member",
  				],
  				"users" : [],
  				"teams" : []
  			},
  			"unregister" = {
  				"roles" : [
  					"Member",
  				],
  				"users" : [],
  				"teams" : []
  			},
  			"update" = {
  				"roles" : [
  					"Member",
  				],
  				"users" : ["test-admin-user@test.com"],
  				"teams" : []
  			},
  			"update_metadata_properties" = {
  				"icon" = {
  					"roles" : [
  						"Member",
  					],
  					"users" : [],
  					"teams" : []
  				},
  				"identifier" = {
  					"roles" : [
  						"Member",
  					],
  					"users" : [],
  					"teams" : ["Team Spiderman"]
  				},
  				"team" = {
  					"roles" : [
  						"Admin",
  					],
  					"users" : [],
  					"teams" : []
  				},
  				"title" = {
  					"roles" : [
  						"Member",
  					],
  					"users" : [],
  					"teams" : []
  				}
  			}
  		}
  }
  
  Allow update `myStringProperty`` for admins and a specific user and team:
  
  resource "port_blueprint_permissions" "microservices_permissions" {
  	blueprint_identifier = "my_blueprint_identifier"
  		entities = {
  			# all properties from the previous example...
  			"update_properties" = {
  				"myStringProperty" = {
  					"roles": [
  						"Admin",
  					],
  					"users": ["test-admin-user@test.com"],
  					"teams": ["Team Spiderman"],
  				}
  			}
  		}
  	}
  }
  
  Allow update relations for a specific team for admins and a specific user and team:
  
  resource "port_blueprint_permissions" "microservices_permissions" {
  	blueprint_identifier = "my_blueprint_identifier"
  		entities = {
  			# all properties from the first example...
  			"update_relations" = {
  				"myRelations" = {
  					"roles": [
  						"Admin",
  					],
  					"users": ["test-admin-user@test.com"],
  					"teams": ["Team Spiderman"],
  				}
  			}
  		}
  }
  
  Disclaimer
  
  Blueprint permissions are created by default when blueprint is first created, this means that you should use this resource when you want to change the default permissions of a blueprint.
  When deleting a blueprint permissions resource using terraform, the blueprint permissions will not be deleted from Port, as they are required for the action to work, instead, the blueprint permissions will be removed from the terraform state.
  You always need to explicity set register|unregister|update|update_metadata_properties properties.
  All the permission lists (roles, users, teams) are managed by Port in a sorted manner, this means that if your .tf has for example roles defined out of order, your state will be invalid
  E.g:
  
  resource "port_blueprint_permissions" "microservices_permissions" {
  	blueprint_identifier = "my_blueprint_identifier"
  		entities             = {
  			# invalid:
  			"register" = {
  				"roles" : [
  					"Member",
  				"Admin",
  				],
  				"users" : [],
  				"teams" : []
  			},
  			# valid
  			"register" = {
  				"roles" : [
  					"Admin",
  				"Member",
  				],
  				"users" : [],
  				"teams" : []
  			},
  			...
  		},
  	},

## Schema

### Required

- `blueprint_identifier` (String)
- `entities` (Attributes) Entities permissions to read the blueprint (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--entities))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--entities"></a>
### Nested Schema for `entities`

Required:

- `register` (Attributes) Manage permissions to register entities of the blueprint (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--entities--register))
- `unregister` (Attributes) Manage permissions to unregister entities of the blueprint (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--entities--unregister))
