  Folder resource
  A full list of the available folder types and their identifiers can be found here https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/folder/catalog-folder.
  ~> WARNING
  The folder resource is currently in beta and is subject to change in future versions.
  Use it by setting the Environment Variable PORT_BETA_FEATURES_ENABLED=true.
  If this Environment Variable isn't specified, you won't be able to use the resource.
  Example Usage
  Basic Folder
  
  
  resource "port_folder" "example_folder" {
    identifier = "example_folder"
    title      = "Example Folder"
  }
  
  
  Folder with Parent
  Create a folder inside another folder.
  
  
  resource "port_folder" "child_folder" {
    identifier = "child_folder"
    parent     = port_folder.example_folder.identifier
    title      = "Child Folder"
  }
  
  
  Folder with After
  Create a folder after another folder.
  Note: When using after without explicitly setting parent, the folder will automatically inherit the parent from the folder specified in after. To create a root-level folder positioned after another folder, explicitly set parent to an empty string or the desired parent identifier.
  
  
  resource "port_folder" "another_folder" {
    identifier = "another_folder"
    after      = port_folder.example_folder.identifier
    title      = "Another Folder"
  }

# Folder resource

A full list of the available folder types and their identifiers can be found [here](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/folder/catalog-folder).

~> **WARNING**
The folder resource is currently in beta and is subject to change in future versions.
Use it by setting the Environment Variable `PORT_BETA_FEATURES_ENABLED=true`.
If this Environment Variable isn't specified, you won't be able to use the resource.

## Example Usage

### Basic Folder

```hcl

resource "port_folder" "example_folder" {
  identifier = "example_folder"
  title      = "Example Folder"
}

```

### Folder with Parent

Create a folder inside another folder.

```hcl

resource "port_folder" "child_folder" {
  identifier = "child_folder"
  parent     = port_folder.example_folder.identifier
  title      = "Child Folder"
}

```

### Folder with After

Create a folder after another folder.

**Note:** When using `after` without explicitly setting `parent`, the folder will automatically inherit the parent from the folder specified in `after`. To create a root-level folder positioned after another folder, explicitly set `parent` to an empty string or the desired parent identifier.

```hcl

resource "port_folder" "another_folder" {
  identifier = "another_folder"
  after      = port_folder.example_folder.identifier
  title      = "Another Folder"
}

```
