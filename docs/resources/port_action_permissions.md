  Action Permissions resource
  Docs for the Action Permissions resource can be found here https://docs.getport.io/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/examples.
  Example Usage
  hcl
  resource "port_action_permissions" "restart_microservice_permissions" {
    action_identifier = port_action.restart_microservice.identifier
    permissions = {
      "execute" : {
        "roles" : [
          "Admin"
        ],
        "users" : [],
        "teams" : [],
        "owned_by_team" : true
      },
      "approve" : {
        "roles" : ["Member", "Admin"],
        "users" : [],
        "teams" : []
      }
    }
  }
  
  Example Usage with Policy
  Port allows setting dynamic permissions for executing and/or approving execution of self-service actions, based on any properties/relations of an action's corresponding blueprint.
  Docs about the Policy language can be found here https://docs.getport.io/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/dynamic-permissions#configuring-permissions.
  Policy is expected to be passed as a JSON string and not as an object, this means that the evaluation of the policy will be done by Port and not by Terraform.
  To pass a JSON string to Terraform, you can use the jsonencode https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode function.
  ```hcl
  resource "portactionpermissions" "restartmicroservicepermissions" {
    actionidentifier = portaction.restartmicroservice.identifier
    permissions = {
      "execute" : {
        "roles" : [
          "Admin"
        ],
        "users" : [],
        "teams" : [],
        "ownedbyteam" : true
      },
      "approve" : {
        "roles" : ["Member", "Admin"],
        "users" : [],
        "teams" : []
        # Terraform's "jsonencode" function converts a
        # Terraform expression result to valid JSON syntax.
        "policy" : jsonencode(
          {
            queries : {
              executingUser : {
                rules : [
                  {
                    value : "user",
                    operator : "=",
                    property : "$blueprint"
                  },
                  {
                    value : "true",
                    operator : "=",
                    property : "$ownedby_team"
              }
            ],
            combinator : "and"
          }
        },
        conditions : [
        "true"]
      }
    )
  }
  
  }
  }
  ```
  Disclaimer
  Action permissions are created by default when creating a new action, this means that you should use this resource when you want to change the default permissions of an action.When deleting an action permissions resource using terraform, the action permissions will not be deleted from Port, as they are required for the action to work, instead, the action permissions will be removed from the terraform state.

# Action Permissions resource

Docs for the Action Permissions resource can be found [here](https://docs.getport.io/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/examples).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "port_action_permissions" "restart_microservice_permissions" {
  action_identifier = port_action.restart_microservice.identifier
  permissions = {
    "execute" : {
      "roles" : [
        "Admin"
      ],
      "users" : [],
      "teams" : [],
      "owned_by_team" : true
    },
    "approve" : {
      "roles" : ["Member", "Admin"],
      "users" : [],
      "teams" : []
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with Policy

Port allows setting dynamic permissions for executing and/or approving execution of self-service actions, based on any properties/relations of an action's corresponding blueprint.

Docs about the Policy language can be found [here](https://docs.getport.io/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/dynamic-permissions#configuring-permissions).

Policy is expected to be passed as a JSON string and not as an object, this means that the evaluation of the policy will be done by Port and not by Terraform.
To pass a JSON string to Terraform, you can use the [jsonencode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode) function.

```hcl

      "owned_by_team" : true
    },
    "approve" : {
      "roles" : ["Member", "Admin"],
      "users" : [],
      "teams" : []
      # Terraform's "jsonencode" function converts a
      # Terraform expression result to valid JSON syntax.
      "policy" : jsonencode(
        {
          queries : {
            executingUser : {

                  property : "$blueprint"
                },
                {
                  value : "true",
                  operator : "=",
                  property : "$owned_by_team"

                }
